# How to Contribute to `rmap`

Thank you for taking the time to contribute and help us advance the science and architecture of `rmap`. We provide few guidelines that we ask contributors to follow. The guidelines aim to ease the maintainers' organizational and logistical duties, while encouraging development by others.

Before you start:

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Trivial changes to comments or documentation do not require creating a new issue.

## Did you find a bug?

* Make sure the bug was not already reported in the Github [Issues](https://github.com/JGCRI/rmap/issues).
* [Open an issue](https://github.com/JGCRI/rmap/issues/new) and clearly describe the issue with as much information as possible. A code sample or an executable test case are recommended.
  
## Did you plan to write a patch that fixes a bug?

  * [Open an issue](https://github.com/JGCRI/rmap/issues/new) and clearly describe the problem and discuss how your solution will affect `rmap`.
  * Fork the repository on GitHub to work on the patch.
  * Interact with the project maintainers to refine/change/prioritize your issue.

## Making changes

* Start your work on your fork of the repository.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` and format code.
* Make sure your commit messages are descriptive but succinct, describing what was changed and why, and **reference the relevant issue number**. Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run **all** the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting changes

* Submit a pull request with clear documentation of the methodology to the main `rmap` repository.
* **Your pull request should include one of the following two statements**:
   * You own the copyright on the code being contributed, and you hereby grant PNNL unlimited license to use this code in this version or any future version of `rmap`. You reserve all other rights to the code.
   * Somebody else owns the copyright on the code being contributed (e.g., your employer because you did it as part of your work for them); you are authorized by that owner to grant PNNL an unlimited license to use this code in this version or any future version of `rmap`, and you hereby do so. All other rights to the code are reserved by the copyright owner.
* The core team looks at Pull Requests, and will respond as soon as possible.
